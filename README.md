# SnakeGame
The Snake game is a popular and classic arcade game where the player controls a snake that moves around a screen. The primary objective is to eat food that randomly appears, causing the snake to grow longer. The game becomes progressively more challenging as the snake grows. The game becomes progressively more challenging as the snake grows. The player must avoid colliding with the walls or the snake's own body to keep playing.

In this description, we will outline how to create a simple Snake game using JavaFX, covering key aspects such as setting up the environment, creating the game window, handling game logic, managing user input, and integrating all components.

# Setting Up the JavaFX Environment
Before starting, ensure JavaFX is correctly set up in your development environment. You can use an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) such as IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse with the appropriate JavaFX libraries.

# Creating the Game Window
The game window is created using the Stage and Scene classes in JavaFX. Here, Stage represents the main window, and Scene holds all the visual components.
# Handling Game Logic
# Snake Representation
The snake can be represented as a list of Rectangle objects. Each Rectangle represents a segment of the snake.
